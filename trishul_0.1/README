README for Trishul 0.1 Release (06 Nov. 2008)
---------------------------------------------

This is version 0.1 release of Trishul (http://www.cs.vu.nl/~srijith/trishul/)
The code is 'graduate-level' quality and is released under the same license as 
Kaffe -  GNU General Public License http://www.kaffe.org/ftp/pub/kaffe/COPYING


Hope these pointers would help get you started on compiling and using Trishul:

- Attempt to compile Trishul only after successfully compiling Kaffe 1.1.7

- Extra libraries and tools will be needed to compile Trishul. In an Ubuntu machines
  these should do it:
  
   - apt-get install sun-java5-jdk  // at least 1.5
   - apt-get install libssl-dev     // for signing
   - apt-get install xorg-dev       // if error with gtk+ peer missins X lib files
   - apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
   - apt-get install ant
   - install jikes, fastjar
   - sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-1.5.0-sun

- JIT mode of Trishul works only with machines having SSE2 CPU support

- gcc 4.1 sometimes creates problems. We think we have sorted them out but if compile 
  fails with weird errors, try using gcc 4.0

- The keytool binary provided by GCJ is not complete. Use the one provided by Sun

- Use the sample scripts in 'conf-trishul' dir of kaffe-1.1.7 to configure Trishul 
  compliation

- Use './configure --help' to see more configure options



Suggested steps for getting Trishul compilation to work is as follows:

- configure either the debug or release build and make it.
- cd to the examples dir. Perform 'make' and 'make test' to check it the binaries 
  pass all the taint tests
- cd back to the kaffe directory and perform make install
