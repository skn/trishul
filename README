Trishul is an system primarily designed to help enforce policies 
associated with data/information. At the core of the architecture 
is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation that supports information 
flow control.

This work was done as part of Ph.D. work of Srijith Nair (https://srijith.net)
at Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. Patrick Simpson developed a lot of the 
code for Trishul. More details can be found at https://srijith.net/vu/trishul/

The code contained here is based off v1.1.7 of the Kaffee JVM and 
was released on 6th Nov 2008.

If you are face any difficulty in compiling and installing Trishul, 
an Ubuntu 6.10 VM is available as virtual appliance for ease of use.
